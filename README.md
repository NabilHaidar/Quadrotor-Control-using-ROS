# Quadrotor-Control-using-ROS

This project is my final year project in Mechanical Engineering: Mechatronics studying at IUT.
The langauge of the thesis is Persian but an English version will be available soon (Insha'llah :) ). Note that you can use google translate tools to translate the Persian thesis into English and that will work fine.

This repository contains:
- A detailed thesis that illustrates all followed steps to control and navigate a quadrotor using Robot Operating System aka ROS.
- The ROS package written in Python in order to control the Drone using ROS.
- Links to most useful sites that will definitely help you complete and continue this project.
